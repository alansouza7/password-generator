# Password Generator 🔐
Password generators are everywhere on the web, most of the sites ask you to create an account in order to use it. Some of them have an option to ask if you want them to generate a random password, and this is what I've created today.

The concept is easier than we think, but it helps to consolidate the basics of JavaScript. I've used for loops, comparison operators, if-else statements, Math random numbers, importing data from a different file, and much more.

## 💻 Reflection

- This project is part of the solo project of the Module 3 on Scrimba frontend career path, it has been built with the purpose of putting into practise the easy yet important concepts of JS. It's been fun to build this up on my own. I've spent 2 days to finish this off, spending the majority of the on the JS functionality, as well as learning how to generate random numbers.

- I wanted to create a project where I could put into practise the mathRandom method, and it was very rewarding to see the result. 

- I've faced a few challenges, such as how to copy the password generated by the app. I've found the answers on stackoverflow and could understand better how to do it.

- Skills learned: for loops, comparison operators, if-else statements, Math random numbers.
